              I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful west coast of INDIA.

            <p>
              I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I
              can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love gaming.

              For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including
              popular frameworks like ReactJS and Angular. I also make the web pretty by using Sass,
              CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the back-end I also work with Javascript (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, etc). But, of
              course, whenever the project requires PHP, I do PHP as well (Wordpress, Laravel, etc).
